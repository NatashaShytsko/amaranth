							<div class="nature__text text px-5">
								<p>How many skin care products do you put on your skin that you would NEVER eat? Experts say that your skin absorbs as much as 60% of the chemicals that you rub into it, so most of the cosmetic products you use wind up in your body no matter what. 100% pure amaranth oil is not only safe to use on the outside of your body, it also has powerful benefits when you take it internally. A few drops under the tongue can support a healthy heart health, boost elasticity in skin and protect the color and thickness of your hair.</p>

								<p><span class="text-center">Squalene</span></p>
							</div>
							<div class="nature__text text px-5">	
								<p>One of the main reasons amaranth oil is so healthy is because of the many powerful antioxidants it contains. One of those antioxidants is squalene. Squalene has such powerful health benefits that in ancient Japan they called it “Warrior’s Blood”. Back then, they squeezed this healthy antioxidant out of shark livers. Today we squeeze squalene out of amaranth seeds. Not only is it a cruelty-free way to get this powerful antioxidant, it’s also the best way. Amaranth seeds are one of the richest plant sources of squalene in nature.</p>

								<p>Dry skin happens because our oil glands “dry up” as we get older. Squalene is responsible for maintaining moisture levels in your skin. Loose skin, thin skin and easily bruised skin all happen in part because we lose elasticity in our skin as we age.</p>

							<p>Nutrients in this oil are said to promote thicker hair growth, protect hair color and moisturize hair follicles. It could help you keep the color of your hair for years to come by fighting back against the oxidative stress that hydrogen peroxide build-up causes in your hair follicles.
